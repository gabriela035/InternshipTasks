# THE STEPS TAKEN TO SOLVE THE EXERCISE

## OPEN A DOCKER UBUNTU CONTAINER
Open a terminal and run `docker run -it ubuntu.` Each container has an image, so if Ubuntu Container's image does not exist, the command will also create an image for it:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac793817-edbd-4d36-9fb0-50b2fb02b1c0)

It should also appear at Docker Desktop at Containers and Images

## PUBLIC IP OF cloudflare.com
Perform a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup on digwebinterface.com  using the command `dig A cloudflare.com` where:
- `dig` = Domain Information Groper, retrieve various DNS records
- `A` = IPv4 address
 (got useful information from https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-ip-address/564125/4)
In my case, it returned *104.16.132.229*

## Map IP address 8.8.8.8 to hostname google-dns
On Windows, open Notepad as an administrator, navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` , add `8.8.8.8 google-dns` to hosts file and then save file. To verify the mapping, run `ping google-dns` and it should be responses from 8.8.8.8

(got useful information from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35095979/how-to-map-a-local-ip-to-a-hostname and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLy9oDHkJpM&ab_channel=PoweruserGuideTV)

## Check if the DNS Port is Open for google-dns
After a Google search, we know 53 is the DNS port. Run `nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8`, wich is a command that queries a DNS server (Google's 8.8.8.8) to resolve a domain name.
If the DNS server is accessible and port 53 is open, it will receive a valid response with an IP address. If port 53 is blocked or DNS is unavailable, it will get an error, as in my case

that means DNS is not accessible. (thank you ChatGPT)

## Modify the System to Use Googleâ€™s Public DNS
### Change the nameserver to 8.8.8.8 instead of the default local configuration
### Perform another public IP lookup for cloudflare.com and compare the results

# FOR notes.js APPLICATION
Open both notes.js and package.json in VSCode (or any IDE), install dependencies (`npm install`) and then run the application with `npm start` (install node and express if necessary)
As requested, change port to 8080.

Following *docs.docker*, in app folder, add a new file named Dockerfile with:

`FROM node:16`  <sup>Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image</sup> 

`WORKDIR /app` <sup>Set the working directory in the container</sup>

`COPY package*.json ./` <sup>Copy package.json and package-lock.json</sup>

`RUN npm install` <sup>Install dependencies</sup>

`COPY . .` <sup>Copy the rest of the application files</sup>

`EXPOSE 8080` <sup>Expose the port the app will run on</sup>

`CMD ["node", "notes.js"]` <sup>Define the command to run the app</sup>


## Build the Docker image locally
Open terminal and run docker `build -t app`. After some time, it should be like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c59c9f-4482-4f83-93ad-81fc4282bd8b)

You can see the built local image in Docker Desktop

## Start an app container
In terminal run `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 app`
so the container is created in Docker Desktop and its running üèÉ. It can be visible in docker logs.

To test if it works, open the port from Docker and insert some data.

## Create a repository for image on DockerHub

First, you should log in to Docker Hub from the Command Line with `docker login`
Tag Your Docker Image: `docker tag image-name username/repository-name:latest`
Push Your Docker Image to Docker Hub: `docker push username/image-name:latest`
Then it should appear in Docker Hub

# Automation using GitHub Actions

In the same folder with the application files add a file named *.github/workflows/docker-build.yml* with the needed actions (more info at https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart)

Used GitHub Secret Repository (just discovered this) for securing some variables.
